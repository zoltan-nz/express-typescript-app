## Why
Our main goal with this project is a feature complete server application.
We like you to be focused on your business and not spending hours in project configuration.

Try it!! We are happy to hear your feedback or any kind of new features.

## Features
- **Beautiful Syntax** thanks to the awesome annotations from [Inversify Express Utils](https://github.com/inversify/inversify-express-utils).
- **Easy API Testing** with included black-box testing.
- **Dependency Injection** done with the nice framework from [Inversify](http://inversify.io/).
- **Fast Database Building** with simple migration and seeding from [Knex](http://knexjs.org/).
- **Simplified Database Query** with the ORM of [Knex](http://knexjs.org/) called [Bookshelf](http://bookshelfjs.org/).
- **Clear Structure** with controllers, services, repositories, models, middlewares...
- **Easy Exception Handling** with our own simple and easy to adopt logic. You will love it.
- **Easy Data Seeding** with our own factories.
- **Custom Commands** are also available in our setup and really easy to use or even extend.
- **Scaffolding Commands** will speed up your development tremendously as you should focus on business code and not scaffolding.
- **Smart Validation** thanks to [class-validator](https://github.com/pleerock/class-validator) with some nice annotations.
- **API Documentation** thanks to [swagger](http://swagger.io/).
- **API Monitoring** thanks to [express-status-monitor](https://github.com/RafalWilinski/express-status-monitor).
- **Integrated Testing Tool** thanks to [Wallaby.js](https://wallabyjs.com/)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
    * on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
    * on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`
* Install yarn globally `npm install yarn -g`

### Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `cp .env.example .env` to copy the example .env file and enter your database connection
* Create a new database. You will find the name in the .env file.
* Run `npm run setup` or enter the following commands manually:
    * `yarn install` to install all dependencies and typings.
    * `npm run db:migrate` to create the schema.
    * `npm run db:seed` to insert some test data.
* `npm run serve` to start the application.

### Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can run the app.
Enter `npm run serve` to start a local server using `nodemon`, which will watch for any file changes and will restart the sever according to these changes.
The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.

## Scripts / Tasks
All script are defined in the package.json file, but the most important ones are listed here.

### Install
* Install all dependencies with `yarn install`

### Linting
* Run code quality analysis using `npm run lint`. This runs tslint.
* There is also a vscode task for this called `lint`.

### Tests
* Run the unit tests using `npm test` (There is also a vscode task for this called `test`).
* Run the black-box tests using `npm run test:black-box` and don't forget to start your application and your [Auth0 Mock Server](https://github.com/hirsch88/auth0-mock-server).

### Running in dev mode
* Run `npm run serve` to start nodemon with ts-node, to serve the app.
* The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`

### Building the project and run it
* Run `npm run build` to generated all JavaScript files from the TypeScript sources (There is also a vscode task for this called `build`).
* To start the builded app located in `dist` use `npm start`.

### Database
* Run `npm run db:migrate` to migrate schema changes to the database
* Run `npm run db:migrate:rollback` to rollback one migration
* Run `npm run db:seed` to seed sample data into the database
* Run `npm run db:reset` to rollback all migrations and migrate any migration again

### Console
* To run your own created command enter `npm run console <command-name>`.
* This list all your created commands `npm run console:help`.

### Scaffolding Commands
All the templates for the commands are located in `src/console/templates`.

* `npm run console make:resource <file>` - Generates a controller, service, requests, repo, model and a migration with CRUD operations.
* `npm run console make:controller <file>` - Generates a controller.
* `npm run console make:service <file>` - Generates a service.
* `npm run console make:repo <file>` - Generates a repository.
* `npm run console make:model <file>` - Generates a model with the props and configurations.
* `npm run console make:middleware <file>` - Generates a basic middleware.
* `npm run console make:request <file>` - Generates a basic request.
* `npm run console make:listener <file>` - Generates a basic listener.
* `npm run console make:exception <file>` - Generates a basic exception.
* `npm run console update:targets <file>` - Reads all the API files and generate a new `constants/Targets.ts` file out of it.

**Example**
```
$ npm run console make:controller auth/auth
// -> creates `api/controllers/auth/AuthController.ts

$ npm run console make:model user
// -> creates `api/models/User.ts
```

## IoC
Our IoC automatically looks through the `controllers`, `listeners` , `middlewares`, `services`,
`repositories` and `models` folders in `src/api/` for files to bound automatically into the IoC - Container, so you have nothing to do.

**However it is very important to keep the naming right, because otherwise our IoC will not find your
created files!!**

## Using the debugger in VS Code
Just set a breakpoint and hit `F5` in your Visual Studio Code.

## API Routes
The route prefix is `/api` by default, but you can change this in the .env file.

| Route       | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **/api/info**   | Shows us the name, description and the version of the package.json |
| **/api/docs**   | This is the Swagger UI with our API documentation |
| **/status** | Shows a small monitor page for the server |
